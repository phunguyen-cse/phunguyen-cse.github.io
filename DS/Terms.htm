		<div class = "subtitle"><span>What is Machine Learning</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>What is the difference amongs Artifical Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining and Pattern Recognization</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li><span>Artificial Intelligence</span> human-like intelligence displayed by software and/or machines, is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”, AI concentrated on mimicking human decision making processes and carrying out tasks in ever more human ways</li><br>
			<li><span>Machine learning</span> algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions, focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</li><br>
			<li><span>Data mining</span> is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes, the process of digging through data to discover hidden connections and predict future trends, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)
				<ul>
					<li>descriptive analytics and predictive analytics are used for unsupervised learning and supervised learning</li>
				</ul>
			</li><br>
			<li><span>Pattern recognition</span> the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Supervised Machine Learning</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset by given "right answers", the trained model is able to make predictions about the output values. </li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Unsupervised Machine Learning</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>Classify or label data without given "right answers"</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Semi-supervised machine learning</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>Use both labeled and unlabeled data for training</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Reinforcement machine learning</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Classification and Regression</span>, supervised learning</div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>classification is about predicting a label</li>
			<li>regression is about predicting a quantity</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Clustering and Associative</span>, unsupervised learning</div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data</li>
			<li>Association analysis</li>
		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Convex Function</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>In mathematics, a real-valued function defined on an n-dimensional interval is called convex (or convex downward or concave upward) if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above or on the graph, in a Euclidean space (or more generally a vector space) of at least two dimensions.</li>

		</div>
		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Underfitting and Overfitting</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li><span>Bias</span> referes to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem</li>
			<li><span>Variance</span> is due to the model's excessive sensitivity to small variations in the training data, refers to the amount by which factor would change if we estimated it using a different training data set</li>
			<li><span>Irreducible error</span> is due to the noisiness of the data itself. The only way to reduce this part of the error is to clean up the data</li>
			<li>Higher the degrees of freedom, may cause overfitting, low bias, high variance</li>
			<li>Lower the degrees of freedom, may cause underfitting, high bias, low variance</li>

		<div class = "subtitle"><span>Avoid Underfitting and Overfitting</span></div>
		<div class = "block">
			<li>Cross Validation
				<ul>
					<li>Overfitting, performs well on training data but generalizes poorly according to the cross-validation metrics</li>
					<li>Underfitting, performs poorly on both training data and the cross-validation metrics</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Learning Curves
				<ul>
					<li>Plots of the model's performance on the training set and the validation set as a function of the training set size</li>
					<li>Underfitting, both curves have reached a plateau, they are close and fairly high</li>
					<li>Overfitting, there is a gap between the curves, the model performs significantly better on the training data than on the validation data</li>
				</ul>
